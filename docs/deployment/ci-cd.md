## GitHub Actions Workflow

### Main Workflow Structure
```yaml
name: Build and Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-push:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    # Enhanced dependency caching (Bun + Playwright)
    # Unit & integration tests (Bun framework)
    # E2E browser tests (Playwright)
    # Code quality checks (Biome + TypeScript)
    # Security scanning (Snyk + Trivy + Docker Scout)
    # Docker multi-platform builds (Cloud Builders)
    # License compliance validation (Bun native)
    # Supply chain verification (SBOM + provenance)
```

### Caching Optimizations

#### Enhanced Playwright Browser Caching
```yaml
- name: Cache Playwright browsers
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: |
      ~/.cache/ms-playwright
      ~/.cache/playwright-browsers
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-playwright-${{ env.PLAYWRIGHT_VERSION }}-${{ hashFiles('package.json') }}-v3
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-playwright-${{ env.PLAYWRIGHT_VERSION }}-${{ hashFiles('package.json') }}-v3
      ${{ runner.os }}-playwright-${{ env.PLAYWRIGHT_VERSION }}-v3
      ${{ runner.os }}-playwright-${{ hashFiles('package.json') }}-v3
      ${{ runner.os }}-playwright-v3
```

**Features:**
- **Dynamic Version Detection**: Extracts Playwright version from package.json for precise cache keys
- **Multi-Path Caching**: Caches both `~/.cache/ms-playwright` and `~/.cache/playwright-browsers`
- **Hierarchical Fallback Strategy**: 4-level restore-keys for maximum cache reuse
- **Conditional Installation**: Installs only system dependencies on cache hit, full installation on cache miss
- **Performance**: Target reduction from ~51s to ~20s (60% improvement)

#### Bun Dependency Caching
```yaml
- name: Cache Bun dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: |
      ~/.bun/install/cache
      node_modules
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-bun-${{ hashFiles('bun.lockb') }}-v2
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-bun-${{ hashFiles('bun.lockb') }}-v2
      ${{ runner.os }}-bun-v2
```

**Benefits:**
- **Lock File Based**: Uses `bun.lockb` hash for precise cache invalidation
- **Two-Tier Caching**: Caches both Bun's internal cache and installed modules
- **Fast Restores**: Typical cache restore time ~5-10 seconds
- **Hierarchical Fallback**: Ensures cache reuse even with minor dependency changes

### Docker Cloud Builders Integration

```yaml
- name: Set up Docker Buildx
  uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
  with:
    driver: cloud
    endpoint: "zx8086/cldbuild"
```

**Benefits:**
- **Enhanced Build Infrastructure**: Dedicated cloud resources for Docker builds
- **Improved ARM64 Performance**: Better cross-platform build support
- **Resource Efficiency**: Reduced GitHub Actions minutes usage
- **Enhanced Caching**: Cloud-native caching for improved build times
- **Scalability**: Better handling of multi-platform builds

**Implementation Approach:**
- **KISS Principle Applied**: Minimal 3-line addition to existing workflow
- **Preserved Features**: All existing security scanning, multi-platform builds, and supply chain security maintained
- **Authentication**: Seamless integration with existing Docker Hub credentials
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Easy rollback available if needed
