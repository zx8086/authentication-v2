# Individual test files
k6 run test/k6/smoke/health-smoke.ts
k6 run test/k6/smoke/tokens-smoke.ts
k6 run test/k6/load/auth-load.ts
k6 run test/k6/stress/system-stress.ts
```

### Performance Test Categories

#### Smoke Tests
- **Health Smoke**: Basic health endpoint validation
- **Tokens Smoke**: JWT generation performance baseline
- **OpenAPI Smoke**: Documentation endpoint performance

#### Load Tests
- **Authentication Load**: Sustained JWT generation under load
- **System Load**: Complete system performance under normal load

#### Stress Tests
- **High Load**: System behavior under extreme load
- **Resource Limits**: Memory and CPU stress testing

### Performance Thresholds
```javascript
export const options = {
  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<100', 'p(99)<200'],
    http_req_failed: ['rate<0.01'],
    http_reqs: ['rate>1000'],
  },
};
```

## Test Environment Configuration

### Environment Variables for Testing
```bash
# Test execution parameters
K6_SMOKE_VUS=3
K6_SMOKE_DURATION=3m
K6_LOAD_TARGET_VUS=20
K6_STRESS_TARGET_VUS=100

## Testing Best Practices

### Unit Testing
- Mock external dependencies (Kong, Redis)
- Test business logic in isolation
- Validate error scenarios thoroughly
- Use descriptive test names and structure

### Integration Testing
- Test service interactions with real dependencies
- Validate circuit breaker behavior
- Test cache implementations and failover
- Verify telemetry and observability

### E2E Testing
- Test complete user flows
- Validate API contracts
- Test authentication and authorization
- Verify error handling and edge cases

### Performance Testing
- Establish performance baselines
- Test under various load conditions
- Monitor resource utilization
- Validate SLA compliance

## Test Data Management

### Test Consumers
Shared test consumer definitions in `test/shared/test-consumers.ts`:
```typescript
export const BASIC_TEST_CONSUMERS = [
  {
    id: "f48534e1-4caf-4106-9103-edf38eae7ebc",
    username: "test-consumer-001",
    custom_id: "test-consumer-001",
    description: "Primary test consumer for basic authentication tests",
  },
  // Additional test consumers...
];
```

### Test Secrets
Secure test secret management in `test/shared/test-consumer-secrets.ts`:
```typescript
export class TestConsumerSecretFactory {
  static generateTestSecret(consumerId: string): ConsumerSecret {
    return {
      key: `test-key-${consumerId}`,
      secret: `test-secret-${consumerId}-${Date.now()}`,
    };
  }
}
```

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
Tests run automatically in CI with proper isolation:
- **Bun Tests**: Unit and integration tests with mocked dependencies
- **Playwright Tests**: CI-safe tests only (Kong-independent)
- **Performance Tests**: Basic smoke tests for regression detection

### Test Artifacts
- **Coverage Reports**: Uploaded to CI for tracking
- **Test Results**: JUnit XML for integration with CI tools
- **Performance Reports**: K6 results for performance monitoring
- **Screenshots/Videos**: Playwright test artifacts on failure

## Debugging Tests

### Debugging Bun Tests
```bash
# Run single test with debug output
bun test --verbose test/bun/specific.test.ts

# Debug with Node.js debugger
bun --inspect test specific.test.ts
```

### Debugging Playwright Tests
```bash
# Debug mode with browser
npx playwright test --debug

# Headed mode
npx playwright test --headed

# Trace viewer
npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
```

### Debugging K6 Tests
```bash
# Verbose output
k6 run --verbose test/k6/specific.ts

# Debug logging
K6_LOG_LEVEL=debug k6 run test/k6/specific.ts
```

## Test Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Update test dependencies monthly
- Review and update performance thresholds
- Validate test coverage remains above 80%
- Update test data and consumers as needed

### Adding New Tests
1. Follow existing test structure and naming conventions
2. Include both positive and negative test cases
3. Add appropriate assertions and error checking
4. Update test documentation and CI configuration

### Test Performance
- Keep test execution time reasonable (<5 minutes for full suite)
- Use parallel execution where possible
- Mock external dependencies to reduce flakiness
- Regular cleanup of test artifacts and temporary data
